# ENGR212-GuessingGame

Simple Guessing Game in Bash 

"The guessingGame.sh should generate a random number that the user has to
guess. Each time after a guess input the program will let the user know if their
guess is too high or too low until they guess the right number. The script should
keep a count of how many guesses have currently been made. If the user the has
made five guesses without guessing correctly the program should give a hint and
let the user know if the number is odd or even. After ten guesses the number should
be given and the user should be notified that a new number has been picked and
they have ten guesses again. The program should end once the user finally guesses
the right number. "
